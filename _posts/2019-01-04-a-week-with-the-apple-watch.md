I spent 4 years at hostel for my undergrad, away from home, and it was easy. I never felt the longing of going back, the call of the familiar. Life was great back then. It is astonishingly different now. I never realised how hard fending for one's self is in the world and how much we depend on each other, until I needed to cook for myself. The familiarity of having friends who could hear me in my room from theirs with one yell, to having none nearby anymore. Sure, I do have friends, but it is not the same. It's funny, people tell you "you'll never get friends like you did in a hostel", but I always assumed I would.
