I'm creating this blog to put out my adventures, plain and simple. I like to write when my emotions are at a high. People say it is therapeutic, and it actually is!

# A little about me (Ha, you thought)
I'm an international student at Columbia! I'm so happy to have started my Master's degree earlier this Fall. Life has been pretty nice so far, obviously with ups and downs.
